<h1>Hi, I'm Sean! <br/>Computer Science Student and Aspiring Software Developer üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</h1>
<p align="justify">I have created this portfolio to evidence my experience with software technologies as well as my love of being creative in problem solving and proactively directing my own learning. It contains a mixture of university and personal projects and it is my goal to keep adding new work as I continue to gather more experience. The main project that I am currently working on is the Auction Mobile App. I hope that this portfolio can impress you and I look forward to the prospect of further developing my skills in a professional context within your organisation.</p>
